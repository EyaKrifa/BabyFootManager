## Modules

The application is structured around several key modules:

- **Game Management** : Allows users to create, delete, and mark games as completed.
- **Real-time Updates** : All changes to games (creation, deletion, completion) are instantly propagated to all connected clients.
- **User Interface** : Includes features to differentiate between completed and ongoing games, and display a real-time counter of ongoing games.
- **Integrated Chat** : Provides a real-time chat feature for users to communicate while using the application.

## Architecture
- **Backend (Node.js)** : The Node.js server handles game management and real-time communication via WebSockets. It connects to a PostgreSQL database to store game information.
- **Database (PostgreSQL)** : stores game-related data, including game status (completed or ongoing).
- **Frontend (JavaScript)** : The frontend is built with JavaScript.
  
## Database Configuration
### Creating the Database and Table

1. **Creating the Database**:
   - Ensure PostgreSQL is installed and running on your machine.
   - Use pgAdmin or a command-line interface to create a new database named `babyfoot`.

2. **Creating the `parties` Table**:
   - Use SQL to create the `parties` table in your `babyfoot` database. Here's the SQL command:
     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE parties (
         id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
         name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
         status VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'active',
         created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
     );
     ```
   - This table includes fields `id` (primary key), `name` (party name), `status` (party status), and `created_at` (timestamp of party creation).
### Connecting to the Database in `server/server.js`
**Configure Database Connection**:
   - Here's an example configuration in your `server.js` file using `pg`:
     ```javascript
     const { Pool } = require('pg');

     const pool = new Pool({
         user: 'your_postgres_user',
         host: 'localhost',
         database: 'babyfoot',
         password: 'your_password',
         port: 5432,
     });
     ```
     Replace `'your_postgres_user'`, `'localhost'`, `'babyfoot'`, `'your_password'`, and `5432` with your PostgreSQL credentials and database configuration.
   - This setup utilizes a connection pool (`Pool`) to efficiently manage connections to the `babyfoot` database. Connection pooling helps improve performance by reusing database connections rather than creating new ones for every request.
